## Key Features

- ðŸ“‹ Patient management (add, view, select)
- ðŸ’Š Prescription creation with multiple drugs
- ðŸ“„ PDF generation for prescriptions
- ðŸ’¾ Local data storage using SharedPreferences
- ðŸŽ¨ Clean Material Design UI

## How It Works

### State Management
The app uses **Provider** for simple state management:
- `PatientService` - Manages patient data and notifies UI of changes
- `PrescriptionService` - Manages prescriptions and notifies UI of changes

### Data Persistence
Data is stored locally using **SharedPreferences**:
- Patients are saved as JSON strings
- Prescriptions are saved as JSON strings
- Data persists between app sessions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed
- Android Studio or Xcode for running on emulator/simulator
- VS Code (recommended) with Flutter extension

### Run the App

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on connected device or emulator
flutter run
```

## Simplified Changes for Beginners

This project has been simplified by:
1. âœ… Removing complex repository pattern - services handle both data and state
2. âœ… Removing unused platform folders (web, linux, macos, windows)
3. âœ… Removing unnecessary config files
4. âœ… Combining provider + repository into simple services
5. âœ… Clear comments explaining what each file does
6. âœ… Straightforward folder structure

## Learning Path

1. **Start with `main.dart`** - Understand app initialization and navigation
2. **Explore `models/`** - See how data is structured
3. **Check `services/`** - Learn how data is saved and loaded
4. **Study `pages/`** - See how screens are built
5. **Review `widgets/`** - Understand reusable components
